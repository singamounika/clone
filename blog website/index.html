            <p class="text">People love photography because it’s a universal language. Photographs also tell a story that makes a lasting impression on their audience. An adorable picture of a baby bear hugging its mom can touch hearts in any part of the world.</p>
                <p class="text">We remember amazing images because of how they make us feel. Looking at an image can evoke any number of emotions. Feelings of happiness, inspiration, joy or curiosity can all come from a single photograph.
                Humans are emotional creatures and we make decisions based on how we feel. As a graphic designer, you should become a master of reaching your audience through emotions and feelings.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Apple Foldable iphone</h3>
            <p class="text"><b>We’ve known for a while Apple is working on a foldable iPhone, and while the Cupertino-based tech giant remains tight-lipped on the matter, people familiar with the project say the company is making substantial progress on this highly anticipated release.</b></p>
            <p class="text">Now top Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo says Apple is expected to launch a foldable iPhone by 2023, though he emphasizes everything depends on the market performance of the company this year.
                Very little is known at this point about this exciting device, but Kuo says the device would feature a screen of around 7.5-inch to 8 inches. 
                Most likely, this is the screen size when the iPhone is not folded (in tablet mode), so overall, the device could be much smaller.</p>

            <p class="text">Testing conducted by Apple in November and December 2022 using pre-production 16-inch MacBook Pro systems with Apple M2 Max, 12-core CPU, 38-core GPU, 96GB of RAM and 8TB SSD....</p>
            <p class="text">At their peak, M2 Pro and M2 Max deliver up to 20% more CPU performance and up to 30% more GPU performance than M1 Pro and M1 Max in the same power envelope. With this unmatched performance per watt, the new MacBook Pro has even longer battery life — and the 41.05-centimetre (16.2‑inch) model has the longest battery life ever in a Mac.            </p>

                <p class="text">Time management is the process of consciously planning and controlling time spent on specific tasks to increase how efficient you are. You may be familiar with setting deadlines, writing to-do lists, and giving yourself small rewards for accomplishing certain activities.
                    Motivating ourselves is a core part of time management—and it takes a bit of effort not only to motivate yourself but to cultivate good habits to work and live more efficiently.</p>
                <p class="text">To develop good routines and habits, you can start by knowing what strategies and best practices are out there. You can experiment with them in your own life to see what works for you.</p>

                <h3 class="title">Business Management</h3>
                <p class="text">Business management is the process of planning, organizing, directing, and controlling the activities of a business or organization to achieve its goals and objectives. It involves overseeing all aspects of a business, from finance and operations to marketing and human resources.</p>
                <p class="text">Not everyone can be a leader or manager at work, and many people don’t want the responsibilities of overseeing employees and processes. Fortunately, others feel called to work in management roles and want to make a meaningful impact on their teams and their employers.
                    Some managers go through company training to learn the skills they need. Others who are new to management “learn by doing,” having to figure things out as they go. Some entry-level managers start the job with formal management education under their belts, which helps them be more confident in their supervisory roles.</p>
